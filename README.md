# Online and Offline Budget Tracker!  

[Link to deployed app](https://github.com/tbonexas/budgettracker)  

## Description:  
This budget track is similar to a mini project we had a few weeks ago to build an app with PWA (Progressive web app). In this case the user will be able to add expenses and deposits to the budget with or without newtwork connection. User will be able to download the app because it is a PWA. While offline user can enter deposits and expenses. When the app comes back online the data will be updated from the offline transaction.
